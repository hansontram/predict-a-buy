Introducing PREDICT-A-Buy: The Ultimate Shopping Companion!

With PREDICT-A-Buy by your side, shopping becomes an adventure, a journey through time. Let the app be your trusty sidekick, anticipating your needs and guiding you through the aisles with its charming personality. Say goodbye to mundane shopping lists and hello to a shopping experience that's as fun and sassy! 

# How does it work?

As a user, you will enter items (e.g., “Greek yogurt” or “Paper towels”) into your list. Each time you buy the item, you mark it as purchased in the list. Over time, the app comes to understand the intervals at which you buy different items. If an item is likely to be due to be bought soon, it rises to the top of the shopping list.

# Features
- Users can look at what's on the list, so the you know what you need to buy.
- Users can navigate among the pages of our application, Home, List and Add Item. 
- A shopping list is a set of items associated with a specific three-word token. We allow users to start new lists, so you can save the things you need to buy or share your shopping list with your friends by entering the existing token. 
- Users can add or delete items to your shopping lists.
- Users can search through your list. 
- Users can mark your items as purchased, so you can track what on your list you do and do not need to buy.
- Overtime, the app advises users about when to purchase things. 
- The app sorts items by how soon you might need to buy them (soon, kind of soon, not soon,and inactive).  

### Notes: 
- Need to buy soon (7 days or fewer until the next purchase)
- Need to buy kind of soon (between 7 & 30 days until the next purchase)
